# Keep Writing Simple.

Writing is supposed to be simple. It's one of the first things we learned to do as a kid. We learned how to draw, write, and speak. Every picture we drew, every alphabet we wrote, and every sentence we made was us learning to communicate with others at an early age.

As we grew older, we learned to write better. But at some point, our writing became a convoluted mess. Why?

## The Problem

Education is good for the mind. It nurtures a state of learning and encourages one to take up new ideas, hobbies, and skills. The problem lies in over-education. It leads to a constant state of neurosis, a form of perfectionism.

## The Evolution

Technology gave birth to different ways of communication through writing. We have telegram, fax, short message service (SMS aka texts), email. Each protocol encouraged writing to be concise. With email, the evolution went strangely haywire. People abused email. They wrote long letters that no one wanted to read.

## The Solution

**KISS** a.k.a. *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. Unless you dream of being an author, you have no incentive to write long letters. You can have big ideas, but keep your content organized and your writing simple. Get to the point. Fluff is for literature. If you're trying to get a message across, remember four letters--KISS. It will save you and others time.
